# What is Muumi?
Muumi is a grocery application inspired by Finnish culture and implemented using Realm Studio.
The name "Muumi" comes from a Finnish word that refers to a clan or group of people with common ancestry.
Traditionally, these groups were based on lineage and led by a chief or head. The word "muumi" is derived from the Old Finnish word "muu," which means "other" or "another."
In modern times, the term is used to refer to a collective of individuals who share a unique cultural heritage and identity.
